Then I added the instagram data myself, using the incredibly helpful www.terracehousesocial.com for links to almost everyone's social media pages. For dates I re-watched and updated a spreadsheet as I went. Most of the data should be good but if you do notice something that doesn't seem right please do reach out.",
